<p>I learned many new lessons during the 1st Quarter in ICT. I learned how to code lists, tables, links, and forms. I also learned the strict rules on how to properly code an HTML file to create a properly displayed webpage. I learned the importance of these coding lessons in real life. These lessons are the foundation for a sustainable and successful website.</p><br/><br/>

<p>These lessons have multiple <b>practical application</b>. They can be used to build basic websites and create a strong basis for advanced website designs. XHTML has strict rules, reminding every coder to build websites with accuracy and precision. It reminds coders to recheck their code before publishing their website. Lists organize terms and points that we write in our website. It makes it easier for viewers to understand your main points or helps them find information much faster. Tables are effective organizers in websites. They divide the website into numerous sections, helping coders classify their information correctly and helping viewers find the information they need. Forms are very important for getting the viewers' feedback. Their responses can help coders improve their websites and reduce bugs.</p><br/><br/>
